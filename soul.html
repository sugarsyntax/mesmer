      <p>Reiki is a hands-on healing modality. This energy is said to be the universal healing life force that flows through all
      living things and keeps us connected and healthy. Its origin is from India and the East. It is said that it has been
      practiced in times before Christ and the Buddha. In China, it&#39;s referred to as Chi. It goes by many names such as: ki,
      in Japan; prana, in India; the Great Spirit, in Native American culture; and it has even been referred to as electromagnetic
      or bio energy in the West. Anyone can tap into the universal life force, and when it flows freely in and outside of us, we
      are at our healthiest and happiest.</p>

            <span class="underline">A Reiki Session</span> is performed in a safe, private, and professional setting, where the client will
            have some time to safely express areas of emotional/physical concern. Clients will then be asked to lie

            into a relaxed meditative state. Reiki is then administered. Crystals and stones may be used in the
            session to aid energy flow. Clothes stay on, so please make sure to come dressed in comfortable

          <p>
              This facial starts by steaming and prepping the skin. Depending on your skin needs, an
              exfoliating treatment mask is selected and applied while you relax and enjoy a shoulder and
              scalp massage. The facial includes simple extractions, high frequency treatment, and lymphatic
              face massage, followed by a soothing, hydrating collagen mask. The client is guided by Wendy
              into a deep relaxation with a progressive meditation. A 20 min Reiki session is then
              administered. The facial finishes with the mask being cleansed, skin moisturized, and spf
              applied if needed. This experience is good for all skin types and promotes self-loving care.

              <span class="underline">Wendy works with the seven main energy points</span> in the body, called
              chakras. Light placing of the hands to these points helps activate reiki energy.
              This stimulates your own natural healing properties. This energy will flow freely
              and self-healing begins to take place. Some describe their reiki experience as a
              warm sensation, or vibration of the skin and muscles; some see colors, and others
              experience deep relaxation and restful sleep. Overall, a reiki session helps
              promotes deep relaxation, mental clarity, and both emotional and physical relief.
              Reiki is not a cure, but it is a wonderful addition to treatments of any kind to aid</p>
