      <p>A little extra about me,</p>
      <img class="ocean" src="pictures/ocean.png">
      <p>
          I started my first business at the tender age of 8 years old. One hot summer, we took a family vacation to
          sunny Mexico. We stayed at my grandma’s house in a colorful and lively little town in the outskirts of
          Guadalajara, Jalisco where my parents grew up. One crisp, lovely morning, I went on a walk to the farmers
      </p>
      <p>
          market where I saw the most interesting thing happening: business transactions. Lots of people exchanging
          goods for money. I was fascinated. Colorful organic fruits and vegetables everywhere, and customers would
          pick what was needed and pay a vendor who had happily grown, provided, and set up the ripe and fresh
          produce for people to purchase. “What a great idea!” I thought: the perfect balance, everyone winning by
          getting what they need. In that moment, I remembered how many fruit trees my grandma&#39;s huge backyard
          had: mandarin trees, lemon trees, lime trees, avocados trees, and red guava trees - how good they all tasted!
          How great would it be if instead of people going out to buy the produce, the produce came to them!! I was 8,
          and it all made sense and seemed so easy! In that moment, I headed to my grandma&#39;s home, grabbed a bucket,
          and filled it up with the best merchandise picked by me. I walked to homes around the neighborhood,
          knocking on doors and selling! It was awesome!! My daddy found out that same day and gave me a huge
          lecture on safety but also on how proud he was of me. My father, in his short time in this world, was a young,
          successful entrepreneur himself, so he understood. After the long caring lecture, I gave that up and started
          thinking of a safe way to open another business. I had the perfect idea: I saved the money I made that day and
          my allowances for a couple weeks, invested in a lot of candy, and set up a candy table outside the house. By age
          10, I had enough experience to sell beauty products. Now here I am, still having adventures and learning.
          Always striving to be the best with the best service!
