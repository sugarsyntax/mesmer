                    you will begin to relax, release old bad habits, escape reality for a moment, and reprogram yourself for success and
                    recharge. This aids in raising your coping mechanism to better handle your unique life situations on a daily basis and

          <h3 class="underline">What is hypnosis?</h3>
          <p>Hypnosis is a natural phenomenon that is part of our creaturehood. It is a heightened state of awareness, a gift when
            directed towards the right direction with the guidance of a hypnotherapist. Hypnosis is activated by an overload of
            message units. When we go into overload, our conscious mind gets distracted and the subconscious mind takes over,
            taking in random suggestions from the environment: some negative, some positive.</p>
          <img src="pictures/trip.png" class="lights_pic pic">

          <p class="side-words"><span class="underline">One example of uncontrolled environmental</span> hypnosis occurs after a long, hard day at work.
            You get in the car, close the heavy door, and feel your shoulders ache. The stretch from
            grabbing the seatbelt only makes you feel more tired, and your back hurts. Your boss’
            upsetting words keep playing over in your head like a broken record. As you turn on the
            engine, the news comes up on the static radio station. The announcer goes on about the bad
            weather, and you remember you have to do laundry. You start driving, and suddenly, you are
            home. You don&#39;t remember how you got there: you know you were driving, but you can’t
            remember doing it. By enhancing your natural hypnosis in a controlled, safe environment, you
            can become absolutely aware of your surroundings. As you enter a heightened state of
            awareness, relaxation takes over, allowing new positive beliefs in and releasing old bad habits,
            reprogramming yourself for success, all with care, safety, and guidance of a professional.</p>
