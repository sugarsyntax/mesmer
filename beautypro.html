      <h2 class="amatic">All Beauty Professionals</h2>
      <p>Students, hair stylists, nail technicians, estheticians, makeup artists, and everyone else in the beauty industry,
        welcome. My name is Wendy Rodriguez, and I am a professional hairstylist and makeup artist, practicing since 1996.
        I attended cosmetology school at Glendale High Beauty Academy, an ROP. I graduated Glendale High in 1995, and
        later that year got licensed in cosmetology. I know, heard, saw, and personally lived and felt the struggles, challenges,
        insecurities, and fears people in our industry face daily in school, on the floor, and behind the scenes with bosses,
        fellow coworkers and so on. I own my own business, in the past with partners, and now by myself. I have been an
        employee and have had employees. I successfully opened and ran a business during the recession in the mid 2000s.
        Iâ€™ve mentored hairstylists down successful career paths. Despite being told many times it cannot be done, I always
        visualized myself achieving it, and it happened. I hold a strong belief that we all have our own truth and beliefs. I am
        here to sincerely and caringly coach and support you on your personal or business endeavor, in whatever stage you
        find yourself. Whether you are a student, new on the floor, at the peak of your career, or a veteran of beauty, I can
        help you better cope with your unique situation.</p>
